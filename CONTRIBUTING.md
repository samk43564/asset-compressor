### Pull Request guidlines

* [Fork][https://github.com/livecodebase/asset-compressor] the repository and [clone][https://github.com/livecodebase/asset-compressor] it locally.
Connect your local repository to the original `upstream` repository by adding it as a [remote][https://github.com/livecodebase/asset-compressor].
Pull in changes from `upstream` often so that you stay up to date and so when you submit your pull request,
merge conflicts will be less likely.
* Create a **branch** for your edits.
* Contribute in the style of the project as outlined above. This makes it easier for the collaborators to merge
and for others to understand and maintain in the future.

### Open Pull Requests

Once you’ve opened a pull request, a discussion will start around your proposed changes.

Other contributors and users may chime in, but ultimately the decision is made by the collaborators.

During the discussion, you may be asked to make some changes to your pull request.

If so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they will automatically go into the existing pull request. But don't forget to squash them.


*Thanks for being a part of this project, and we look forward to hearing from you soon!*
